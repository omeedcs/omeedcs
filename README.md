## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is [Omeed Tehrani](https://github.com/omeedcs), nice to meet you!

<div>
<p>
 
I am a Computer Science major at UT Austin with a concentration in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am also minoring in Business! I am extremely involved and fascinated with Capital Markets and Algorithmic Trading. I also have a large interest in Software Engineering and creating products and tools to advance society. My future goals are to become an accomplished Software Engineer at a technology company or Quantitative firm. My goals extend beyond my undergraduate, and I could see myself possibly becoming a ML Researcher, Quantitative Trader or Quantitative Analyst. Overall, through projects, engineering experience and research, I hope to use my deep passion of technology to become a driving force in the change that people and myself want to see.

I am always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new people to collaborate with. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any of my projects. Currently, there are a couple of things I hope to accomplish by the Summer of 2022. 
 
1) I hope to master the fundamentals of the functional programming language, Ocaml.
2) Create some trading algorithms through application of my statistical and programming knowledge.
3) Build my first trading bot with Ocaml or Python.
4) Revamp my website and post all my hand-written and computer typed notes and accomplishments on a blog.
